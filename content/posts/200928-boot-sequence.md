## Meaning...

`sttp://secure-thoughts-transfer-protocol` has been written and by 
[Harman](https://twitter.com/hrmnjts). Web nerdery here is created using SSG - 
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) deployed on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com), 
because who doesn't love free hosting.

I really love when websites respect privacy on wild-wild internet and in the 
same spirit I've disable core functionalities to track usage and comments. 
I'm happy to discuss comments on [birdy platform](https://twitter.com) or 
[older birdie platform](mailto:hrmnjt@hrmn.in) instead.

Have a good day!
