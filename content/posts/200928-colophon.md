Hi there! Welcome to my blog. As part of customary first post, let me start by 
re-iterating what you might already know i.e. definition of the title.

> **col·o·phon** - a publisher's emblem or imprint, usually on the title page 
> of a book.  
> -- [Google](https://www.google.co.in/search?q=define+colophon)

## Explaining ...

`sttp://secure-thoughts-transfer-protocol` has been written and by 
[Harman](https://twitter.com/hrmnjts). Web nerd-ery here is created using 
static site generator [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) deployed on 
[Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) for free.

I really love when websites respect privacy on wild-wild internet and in the 
same spirit I've disable core functionalities to track usage and comments. I'm happy to discuss comments on [birdy platform](https://twitter.com) or 
[older birdie platform](mailto:hrmnjt@hrmn.in) instead.

Have a good day!
