I work as a Data engineer [@MajidAlFuttaim](https://twitter.com/MajidAlFuttaim) 
and have worked for [@MuSigmaInc](https://twitter.com/MuSigmaInc) for the 
longest time. I currently live in Dubai (originally from Jamshedpur). I'm 
generally found either (and not in any order)
- tweeting
- playing DoTA2
- coding
- listening to classical rock guitar solos
- reading about psychology, shower-thoughts, what-ifs, statistical modeling, 
infrastructure, systems design and skynet
