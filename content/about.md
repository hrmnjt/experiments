I work at ~~[@MuSigmaInc](https://twitter.com/MuSigmaInc)~~ 
[@MajidAlFuttaim](https://twitter.com/MajidAlFuttaim) on ~~data analytics~~, 
~~backend applications~~, ~~recommendation engines~~, system programming, 
analytical and transactional database systems, yaml engineering and dataops.

I currently live in Dubai and generally found either (and not in any order)
- programming
- tweeting or reading the tweets
- playing DoTA2
- listening to classical rock guitar solos or reading about psychology, 
shower-thoughts, what-ifs, statistical modeling, infrastructure, systems design 
and skynet
